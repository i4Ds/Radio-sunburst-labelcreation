# Burst List generation
## Installation
Create a python virtual environment and install the requirements.

## Usage
### Creating burst lists
See notebook `burst_list_creation.ipynb` for an example of how to use the code. 
Because there are typos and other errors in the original data, a notebook is provided for the user to fix these errors.
The data is created from from the files found here: http://soleil.i4ds.ch/solarradio/data/BurstLists/2010-yyyy_Monstein/

### Data creation
The notebook `create_data.ipynb` allows together with the `burst_list.xlsx` (generated `burst_list_creation.ipynb``) generation of burst and non-burst images.

### EDA
Some EDA is done in `eda.ipynb`.
